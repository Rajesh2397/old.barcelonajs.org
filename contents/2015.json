This talk is about CodeMirror, one such editor. It'll explore the intricacies of faking an editable control, the challenges of making it scale to hundreds of thousands of lines, and the integration of modern code editor features."

For many companies the cost of develop and maintain two parallel environments is very expensive, and of course for a logic reason it isn't a good approach. At present, Many solutions exist to solve this, PhoneGap, Xamarin, the recent but only introduced ReactJS Native and of course Ionic. In this speech I will show how it works with some demos and the pros and cons about to use Ionic to develop web mobile apps for the real world."

Facebook's open source UI library React.js introduces a sane solution to building UI's, based on uni-directional flow and components with clear interfaces. Although object oriented in appeareance, React builds itself on a functional programming basis, making programs written by this library easy to develop and reason about. In this talk, we will go over the founding principles of this exciting library which has been steadily gaining popularity since it was first introduced in May 2013. We will also briefly talk about accompanying technologies such as Flux, immutablejs and react-router."

    "description": "jqComponents (http://jqcomponents.com) is a small, open source toolkit / framework that brings structure and UI components to your jQuery powered web apps.\njQuery is incredibly flexible, powerful and easy to use. But - jQuery doesn't standardize how to structure bigger apps. Therefore:\n1) The app code tends to become very DOM-centric (partly because of how jQuery plugins work).\n2) The app code tends to become unstructured - looking like one, big main method\njqComponents is designed to solve both of these problems, by providing a standardized way to divide your code into components and modules. Inside both of these, you can use the power of jQuery freely. jqComponents comes with a set of standard UI components, so you don't have to build everything from scratch. You can create a custom build of jqComponents from the project website, so you don't need to include more than you actually use. jqComponents started as a hobby project of mine, but has now gone through 11 releases (in 2014), and will go through some this year too. I will be using it in several different projects this year. This talk is not intended to be a complete \"how to use jqComponents\" talk. Rather, it will explain the reasoning behind its internal design. I am sharing this with the JS community to get your feedback. Is this a useful model? Is it flawed? How does it compare to e.g. Web Components etc. Let's get a discussion going."

    "description": "Nowadays a lot of applications are being developed not using a single language but more than one.\nOne of the most used paradigm is implementing the front-end using Html + JavaScript (for example with AngularJs) and implementing the back-end with Java.\nThere is a lot of test frameworks for Javascipt code and the same for Java, but if you want to test system wide in an automatic way it seems that you need some kind of glue to meet both worlds.\nCome to this session to learn how Arquillian can help you on writing tests for these applications."
