We'll see how virtual DOM implementations like React open up possibilities for a functional architecture in our applications, which can be radically simpler than traditional approaches. The main benefits are a sound separation of concerns, better reasoning about the systems we design and the ability to easily test our applications."},{"title":"Data structures of the revolution","level":"advanced","language":"en","speaker":{"twitter":"substack","name":"James Halliday","portrait":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12631?v=3&s=400"},"description":"blob storage, logs, and DHTs!
