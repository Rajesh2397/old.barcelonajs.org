We'll see how virtual DOM implementations like React open up possibilities for a functional architecture in our applications, which can be radically simpler than traditional approaches. The main benefits are a sound separation of concerns, better reasoning about the systems we design and the ability to easily test our applications."},{"title":"TypeScript will finally bring peace to your troubled soul","level":"beginner","language":"en","speaker":{"twitter":"pimterry","name":"Tim Perry","portrait":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1526883?v=3&s=400"},"description":"You've heard of TypeScript, but you're not sure if it's a good idea, and you've never really seen it in action. TypeScript is powerful though, rapidly gaining momentum, and has a lot more to offer than just JS + classes. Let's take a proper look. In this talk we'll dig a bit deeper and play around with some of the more interesting features TypeScript gives you. We'll walk through the extras that TypeScript provides and how they'll solve your every woe, learn a bit about where the types come in and why'd you care, and see how exactly you might put it into action on your next Node project."}]
